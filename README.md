# Acquia Lift Code Samples
This repo provides code samples and integration examples for Acquia Lift. This is for reference only and should not be used in any production site. There are two primary integration points we explore here:

1) [Acquia Lift API](https://docs.acquia.com/lift/api/ "Acquia Lift API")
>Acquia Lift includes several interfaces, exposed as APIs, that you can use to interact with stored visitor data. You can use the APIS to both import and export data from the Acquia Lift service.

2) [Acquia Lift PHP SDK](https://github.com/acquia/lift-sdk-php "Acquia Lift PHP SDK")
> A PHP Client library to consume the Acquia Lift APIs.

## Roadmap
No defined roadmap at this time. Feel free to contribute back!

## Support
This project is a reference architecture similar to the `examples` module. It is not intended to be used directly. Use this to inform your architecture, and to experiment with your plans very quickly.

This code is provided as-is with no warranty. This is a community reference project! We hope this provides value to everyone, but this is **not an official Acquia product**.
